# What is XUI ?
XUI ( External User Interfaces ) is a system similar to 5M's NUI system. The only difference is that it is external, not native. It is completely streamproof. You can develop unique interfaces with the trio of Javascript, HTML, CSS. You can also make key simulations and code autofarm scripts with Javascript. XUI is freedom and it's up to your imagination!
